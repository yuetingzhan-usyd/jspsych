This study aims to understand how metacognitive self-evaluation affects cognitive performance.<br><br>Self-evaluation involves rating or evaluating your performance in some way. Self-evaluating while performing cognitive tasks (e.g., problem-solving tasks, memory tests) has been shown to affect performance. Generally, self-evaluation has a positive effect on cognitive performance, though this is not always the case. This research is interested in how people change their approach to problem-solving and other cognitive problems as a result of being asked to self-evaluate. <br><br>The study randomly assigned participants to complete a cognitive task either with or without prompting them to self-evaluate (by asking them to provide self-report ratings of their performance). We will assess how performing this self-evaluation affected cognitive performance on the task (i.e. did it improve or impair performance).<br><br>If you have any questions, now or at a later time, please feel free to contact Dr Kit Double (kit.double@sydney.edu.au) <br><br>The ethical aspects of this study have been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of The University of Sydney [INSERT HREC Approval No. once obtained] according to the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research (2007).<br><br>If you are concerned about the way this study is being conducted or you wish to make a complaint to someone independent from the study, please contact the University:<br><br>Human Ethics Manager<br>human.ethics@sydney.edu.au<br>+61 2 8627 8176<br><button onclick="window.print();return false;" />Print</button><h4 style = "color:#e1310e; text-align: center;">This debrief statement is for you to keep</h3></div><div style="text-align: center;">'
